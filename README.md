# SeqNexus

A browser-based molecular biology sequence editor. Renders DNA sequences using
Canvas 2D with annotation display, selection, inline editing, and zoom. Designed
for genome-scale sequences; tested up to around 5 Mb, which is a limit of what
has been exercised rather than of the data structures. Builds to a single
self-contained HTML file.

## Repo Layout

```
.                        the published site (GitHub Pages → seqnexus.app)
├── index.html               landing page (hand-written, not built)
├── app.html                 the built editor — generated, commit it
├── *.worker-<hash>.js       the editor's Web Workers — generated, commit them
├── impressum.html / datenschutz.html
├── assets/                  favicons, screenshots
├── wasm/                    MAFFT, MUSCLE and Kalign (biowasm), run by the alignment tool
└── app/                     Vite + React source for the editor
    ├── app.html                 Vite entry — builds to ../app.html
    └── src/
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev           # dev server on :8000
npm test              # 2,000+ tests
npx tsc -b --noEmit   # type check
npm run build         # tsc -b && vite build
```

The dev server mirrors the deployed site: `/` serves the landing page and
`/app.html` serves the editor built live from `src/`.

## Publishing

`npm run build` writes straight into the repo root (`app.html` plus one
hashed `*.worker-*.js` chunk per worker), so publishing is just committing the
result. Both are build output and both must be committed: `app.html` loads the
workers by relative URL, so a missing chunk silently breaks ORF finding, enzyme
scanning, primer design, alignment, annotation matching, GenBank parsing,
cloning libraries or Sanger assembly. `wasm/` is not built but is loaded the
same way, so it must be published too.

Stale worker chunks from a previous build are pruned automatically at the start
of each build.

> `build.outDir` is the repo root, so `emptyOutDir` is pinned to `false` in
> `app/vite.config.ts`. Do not turn it on — it would delete the repository.

## Architecture

### Data Structures

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `PieceTable` | AVL-tree-backed piece table. O(log n) insert/delete/charAt. |
| `IntervalTree` | Augmented AVL interval tree. O(log n + k) range queries for annotations. |
| `Sequence` | Wraps PieceTable. Topology (linear/circular). |
| `Annotation` | Feature model with coordinates, strand, qualifiers. |
| `Document` | Combines Sequence + Annotations. Edit operations + undo snapshots. |

#### PieceTable

The sequence buffer uses a piece table rather than a flat string. The original
file content is stored in a read-only buffer; all edits append to a separate
"add" buffer. Edit operations create or split small piece descriptors instead
of copying the entire sequence. The pieces are organized in an AVL tree keyed
by cumulative length, giving O(log n) positional access, insert, and delete
where n is the number of pieces (not the sequence length). This makes editing
a 5 Mb genome as fast as editing a 5 kb plasmid.

#### IntervalTree

Annotations are stored in an augmented AVL interval tree keyed by start
position. Each node carries a `maxEnd` value for its subtree, allowing range
queries to prune entire subtrees that can't overlap the query range. This
gives O(log n + k) overlap queries where k is the number of results - used
on every frame to find which annotations are visible in the current viewport.

### Rendering

All sequence rendering uses Canvas 2D with uniform row heights. Row Y position
is computed as `index × rowHeight` - pure arithmetic from scroll offset. A
`ResizeObserver` triggers redraws when the container resizes.

Three render modes based on zoom level:
- **Line** (zoom 0-6): thin backbone, annotation bars, ruler
- **Dots** (zoom 7-12): colored dots per base on backbone
- **Letters** (zoom 13-20): full base letters + complement strand

Only visible rows are drawn. The canvas is translated by the scroll offset
and rows outside the viewport are skipped entirely. This keeps frame times
constant regardless of sequence length.

### Web Workers

Compute-intensive operations run off the main thread:
- `orf-finder.worker` - 6-frame ORF scanning
- `enzyme-finder.worker` - restriction site scanning (546 enzymes, IUPAC expansion)
- `primer-design.worker` - primer candidate enumeration, scoring and pairing (long-lived)
- `genbank-parser.worker` - streaming GenBank parser for large files
- `annotate-list.worker` - annotation matching with k-mer pre-filter
- `alignment.worker` - built-in pairwise and multiple sequence alignment
- `aligner.worker` - one MAFFT, MUSCLE or Kalign job (WebAssembly from `wasm/`)
- `cloning.worker` - combinatorial cloning libraries
- `assembly.worker` - Sanger read assembly

---

## Storage & Persistence

### Why IndexedDB + localStorage

localStorage has a ~5 MB quota in most browsers. A single GenBank file for a
bacterial genome can exceed that. IndexedDB has a much larger quota (typically
hundreds of MB to GB) and handles binary/string data efficiently.

SeqNexus uses a hybrid approach:
- **IndexedDB** stores the large data: base strings, chromatogram trace data,
  and alignment result matrices.
- **localStorage** stores the small metadata: tab layout, annotation
  coordinates, folder structure, theme, ORF/enzyme search parameters.

This split keeps the metadata fast to read (synchronous `localStorage.getItem`)
while allowing arbitrarily large sequences to persist across sessions.

### Persistence format

Base strings are omitted from the localStorage JSON and stored in IndexedDB
keyed by tab ID. On load, metadata is read from localStorage first, then
base strings are fetched from IndexedDB and reassembled into full document
snapshots.

### Orphan cleanup

On every save, the app compares the set of tab IDs in the current session
against the set of keys in IndexedDB. Any IndexedDB entries without a
matching tab are deleted. This prevents storage leaks when tabs are closed.

### Auto-save

Session state is saved automatically with a 1-second debounce after any
state change. If the save fails due to quota, a persistent error toast
warns the user to export their work.

---

## Selections

A selection is a range of bases. On a circular sequence it may run across the
origin. Dragging leftwards records that direction, and the selection's
translation reads the bottom strand from the last base.

### Several ranges

Ctrl+drag (Cmd on a Mac) selects another range next to the ones already
selected, and Ctrl+click on a feature, a primer or an enzyme label adds that
item's bases. On an auto-annotation suggestion or an ORF, Ctrl+click still
picks the item for conversion to a feature. A Ctrl+click inside a selected
range, without dragging, removes that range. Without Ctrl, a click or a drag
replaces the whole selection. Every range has its own drag handles.

The circular map works the same way: Ctrl+drag along the backbone selects a
range, following the direction the pointer turns, so a drag that carries on
past the top of the map selects across the origin rather than going back the
short way. A whole turn stops one base short of the whole circle. A plain
drag on the map still pans it when zoomed in.

- **Merging.** Ranges that overlap or touch become one range. On a circular
  sequence, a range ending at the last base touches one starting at the first.
  A drag is merged against the ranges as they were when it began. A handle
  dragged into another range joins the two, and dragging it back out
  separates them again until the button is released.
- **The active range** is the one last made or dragged. The caret, the arrow
  keys and every tool that needs one stretch of sequence (primer design, the
  Clone This Selection submenu, PDF export) act on it alone. While several
  ranges are selected, the context menu leaves out New Primer, Clone This
  Selection and Paste Reverse Complement.
- **Reading order** is left to right along the sequence, each range read 5'
  to 3'. A range across the origin of a circular sequence is read first, the
  order in which a GenBank `join()` across the origin is written.

### Joined translation

With several ranges selected, the selection's translation reads them as one
sequence, the way a spliced CDS reads its exons. A codon can take bases from
two ranges, and its chip is then drawn in two parts, one over each range.
The direction is that of the active range: if it was dragged leftwards, the
whole joined sequence is read as its reverse complement, starting from the
last base of the last range. The ranges are not translated separately,
because a split coding sequence is the common reason to select several
ranges at once.

### Copying, deleting, typing

- **Copy** (Ctrl+C) puts the joined bases on the clipboard in reading order.
  The context menu also offers the reverse complement, the protein, FASTA as
  one joined record, and FASTA with one record per range.
- **Delete, Backspace and Cut** remove every range in one undo step. The
  spans are deleted from the end of the sequence backwards, so each deletion
  leaves the earlier spans where they were.
- **Typing and pasting** are refused while several ranges are selected. It
  would not be clear which range the new bases replace, or whether all of
  them do.
- **Add Joined Annotation** makes one feature with a part per range, in
  reading order, which a GenBank file writes as `join()`. The form shows the
  parts in place of the start and end, and its One Span button annotates the
  whole stretch from the first part to the last instead.

### Joined features

A feature with parts (the exons of a spliced CDS, or one made from several
ranges) is drawn part by part, with a thin line across each intron in the
sequence view and a thin arc on the map. Edges at an intron are square, and
the arrow is only on the part the feature ends in. Its translation reads the
exons only, joined as the selection's ranges are, from `/codon_start` on, so
a codon split by an intron is drawn in two pieces with one residue. Copying
the feature's protein reads the exons too; copying its bases gives the whole
span, introns included. Clicking anywhere on the feature's span, introns
included, selects the whole span.

The extra ranges are tied to the tab and to the sequence's edit count. Any
change to the bases, including undo and redo, drops them. Base edits rewrite
the sequence in place, so ranges kept across an edit could point at the
wrong bases.

---

## Find

Ctrl+F in the sequence view opens a floating Find panel. A selection of up
to 1 kb becomes the query. The engine is `search/find.ts`; the store runs it
on every change of query, options or bases, so hits never point at bases
that an edit has moved. Coordinates are 0-based and end-exclusive on the
forward strand. On a circular sequence a hit may run across the origin and
then keeps `end > length` (unwrapped), so hits still sort by start.

### Nucleotide search

- **Exact and IUPAC.** The query becomes a regular expression, each IUPAC
  code a character class (N is `[ACGTU]`, R is `[AG]`, and so on; T and U are
  one base). A sequence N is not a base call, so it matches only a query N
  when ambiguity codes are off (then the query is literal). Hits may overlap:
  "AA" in "AAAA" is three sites, because each is a place a primer could sit.
- **Both strands.** The reverse complement of the query is searched as a
  second pattern. A window found by both (a palindrome such as GAATTC, or an
  ambiguous query whose two orientations fit the same bases, such as AN and
  NT on "AT") is one hit on both strands, not two.
- **Mismatches (0 to 3).** Every offset is compared directly, base against
  query code as bitmasks (A 1, C 2, G 4, T 8; a code is the OR of its bases),
  and a window is abandoned at its (k+1)th difference. That is O(n·m) at worst
  but a few comparisons per position on real sequence, which is fast enough
  for primer-length queries on a bacterial genome. An index (k-mer seeds, as
  primer binding uses) was not needed at these sizes and would not cover a
  query shorter than its seed.
- **Regex.** Searched as written, forward strand only: a regex has no
  general reverse complement. Hits do not overlap, as usual for a regex.
- **Across the origin.** The sequence is searched with its first m - 1 bases
  appended (1 kb for a regex), keeping hits that start before the end. One
  pass covers both strands' wrapped hits.

Pasted spaces and position numbers (as in a GenBank listing) are dropped
from the query. Any other character that is not a code is reported by name
rather than matched, so a typo cannot quietly match something else.

### Protein search

All six frames are translated with the genetic code chosen for the
translation display, and searched as text; hits map back to the codons they
cover, with their strand and frame (offset 0, 1 or 2 from the 5' end of
their strand). X matches any residue except a stop, B is D or N, Z is E or
Q, J is I or L. The six translations are cached until the bases or the code
change, since translating a genome is most of the cost of each keystroke.
Mismatches are not offered in protein mode.

### Limits

A search keeps at most 100,000 hits. A one-letter query on a genome has
millions, which say nothing more in the list or on the map and would cost
hundreds of megabytes. The kept hits are always every hit up to some
position, never an uneven sample of the two strands.

### Replace

The replacement is bases in both modes. A reverse-strand hit gets the
reverse complement of the replacement, so the strand the hit was found on
reads as typed. In protein mode only A, C, G and T are accepted, since most
amino acid letters are also IUPAC codes and a peptide typed by mistake would
otherwise go in as degenerate DNA. Replace all works right to left so the
positions still to come do not move, and skips a hit that overlaps one
already replaced (hits on the two strands, or with mismatches, can overlap)
rather than splicing one replacement into another. A hit across the origin
is replaced in two pieces, with the new bases placed at the end.

### Display

Hits are drawn on the strand they read on when both strands are shown as
letters, and over the whole line otherwise. The minimap and the plasmid map
mark every hit (map marks closer than 3 px are merged), the current one
stronger. The panel lists the hits with position, strand, frame, the
smallest feature containing the hit, and a few bases of context read in the
hit's own orientation, with mismatched bases marked.

## Sequence Alignment

### Algorithms

Multiple alignment normally runs MAFFT 7.520, MUSCLE 5 or Kalign 3: the
biowasm WebAssembly builds kept in `wasm/` (see `wasm/README.md`), one job per
worker so a job can be cancelled. "Automatic" picks MAFFT L-INS-i where it is
quick enough, Kalign for large sets, and the built-in pairwise aligner for two
sequences.

The built-in algorithms are pure TypeScript with no external dependencies:

#### Needleman-Wunsch (global pairwise)

Standard three-matrix DP (M, Ix, Iy) for affine gap penalties. For sequences
where m × n > 10k × 10k cells, the implementation switches to **Hirschberg's
divide-and-conquer** algorithm, which reduces memory from O(mn) to O(min(m,n))
while producing the same optimal alignment. This allows global alignment of
sequences up to ~22 kb × 22 kb (500M cells limit) without exhausting browser
memory.

#### Smith-Waterman (local pairwise)

For matrices up to 50M cells, uses the standard O(mn) DP with full traceback.
For larger inputs, uses a three-pass linear-memory approach:
1. Forward pass (O(n) memory) to find the best score and end position
2. Reverse pass to find the start position
3. Full DP only over the bounded local region

#### Seeded Smith-Waterman (large local)

When the full DP matrix would exceed 500M cells (e.g., aligning a 4 kb read
against a 4.6 Mb genome), the app uses a seed-and-extend strategy inspired
by BLAST and minimap2:
1. Build a k-mer hash index (k=11) of the reference sequence
2. Find seed matches from the query
3. Chain seeds along diagonals (greedy, gap-tolerant)
4. Extract a bounded reference region around the best chain
5. Run Smith-Waterman on the bounded region only

This reduces a 4 kb × 4.6 Mb alignment to a hash lookup plus SW on ~4 kb × ~8 kb.
Highly repetitive k-mers (>500 occurrences) are skipped to limit memory.

#### Progressive MSA (multiple sequences)

For 3+ sequences, uses progressive multiple sequence alignment:
1. Compute all-pairs distance matrix via pairwise NW scores
2. Build a UPGMA guide tree
3. Align sequences/profiles progressively following the tree

Profile-profile alignment uses position-specific scoring: the score for
aligning two columns is the average of all pairwise residue scores across
the two profiles.

### Scoring

- **DNA**: configurable match/mismatch scores (default +1/-1)
- **Protein**: BLOSUM62 substitution matrix (standard NCBI 20×20)
- **Gap penalties**: affine model with separate open and extend penalties

### Size limits

| Scenario | Strategy | Max size |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Global pairwise | Full DP or Hirschberg | ~22 kb × 22 kb |
| Local pairwise (small) | Full DP | ~7 kb × 7 kb |
| Local pairwise (large) | Linear-memory SW | ~50 kb × 50 kb |
| Local pairwise (genome) | Seeded SW | 4 kb × 5 Mb+ |
| Global pairwise (too large) | Rejected with error | - |

All alignment runs in a Web Worker to keep the UI responsive.

## Melting Temperature (Tm)

Tm appears in the selection tooltip (for selections of 4-200 bp), the primer
hover card and menu, and the primer design tool.

### Selection tooltip

- **≤ 14 bp**: Wallace rule - `Tm = 2×(A+T) + 4×(G+C)`. Simple base-counting
  formula for very short oligos.
- **15-200 bp**: nearest-neighbor method (see below).
- **> 200 bp or < 4 bp**: Tm is not shown.

Default conditions: 250 nM oligo, 50 mM Na⁺. These are not user-configurable
for the selection tooltip - they use the same defaults as the primer design tool.

### Nearest-neighbor method

Uses the **SantaLucia (1998) unified nearest-neighbor model** for DNA/DNA
duplexes.

#### Parameters

Enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) are computed by summing contributions from
each adjacent dinucleotide step plus initiation parameters based on terminal
base pairs:

| Terminal base | ΔH_init (cal/mol) | ΔS_init (cal/mol·K) |
|---------------|------------------:|---------------------:|
| G or C        |               100 |               −2.8   |
| A or T        |              2300 |                4.1   |

The 10 unique nearest-neighbor parameters (with symmetry equivalents):

| Pair  | ΔH (cal/mol) | ΔS (cal/mol·K) |
|-------|-------------:|----------------:|
| AA/TT |        −7900 |          −22.2  |
| AT    |        −7200 |          −20.4  |
| TA    |        −7200 |          −21.3  |
| CA/TG |        −8500 |          −22.7  |
| GT/AC |        −8400 |          −22.4  |
| CT/AG |        −7800 |          −21.0  |
| GA/TC |        −8200 |          −22.2  |
| CG    |       −10600 |          −27.2  |
| GC    |        −9800 |          −24.4  |
| GG/CC |        −8000 |          −19.9  |

#### Tm calculation

```
Tm(1M) = ΔH / (ΔS + R × ln(Ct/4)) − 273.15
```

where R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K) and Ct is the total primer concentration in M.
The Ct/4 term assumes non-self-complementary oligonucleotides.

#### Salt correction

The Tm at the actual salt concentration uses the **Owczarzy et al. (2004)
monovalent cation correction**:

```
1/Tm(Na) = 1/Tm(1M) + (4.29e-5 × f_GC − 3.95e-5) × ln([Na⁺])
                     + 9.40e-6 × (ln([Na⁺]))²
```

When Mg²⁺ is provided (primer design only), the **Owczarzy (2008) divalent
correction** is used instead, with free Mg²⁺ = Mg²⁺ − dNTPs (1:1 chelation).

### Hairpin and self-dimer Tm

The primer hover card and the design workbench show the Tm of each oligo's
strongest hairpin and self-dimer (`app/src/primers/secondary.ts`). This is a
**simplified nearest-neighbor model**, not Primer3's full thermodynamic
alignment, so the numbers are shown as estimates (≈). They are calculated
for the whole oligo, tails included, under the design tool's default buffer.

What is simplified: only ungapped helices count. A hairpin stem must pair
perfectly. A dimer may contain single internal mismatches. Neither may
contain bulges or internal loops. Hairpins get no special triloop or
tetraloop bonuses.

#### Self-dimer

1. Slide the oligo antiparallel along a second copy of itself. At every
   offset, find the most stable ungapped paired stretch (ΔG37 from the NN
   tables, including single internal mismatches). Keep the stretch with the
   lowest ΔG37 overall (`bestDimer` in `structure.ts`).
2. Score that stretch as a duplex: ΔH and ΔS from the unified NN parameters,
   the internal-mismatch parameters (Allawi & SantaLucia 1997–98, Peyret
   1999) and the initiation terms, as in the duplex Tm above.
3. Both strands are the same molecule. At the Tm half of all strands are
   paired, so the equilibrium constant is 1/Ct instead of the 4/Ct used for
   two different strands:

   ```
   Tm(1M) = ΔH / (ΔS + R × ln(Ct))
   ```

4. Apply the Owczarzy (2008) salt correction to the stretch's own GC
   fraction and length.

Because the dimer is bimolecular, its Tm rises with oligo concentration.

#### Hairpin

1. Try every loop of 3 or more bases. For each one, zip the stem outward
   from the loop for as long as the bases pair perfectly (at least 3 bp).
2. Score each fold:

   ```
   ΔH = Σ ΔH(stem NN pairs) + ΔH(terminal mismatch)
   ΔS = Σ ΔS(stem NN pairs) + ΔS(terminal mismatch) − ΔG37(loop) / 310.15 K
   ```

   - **Stem pairs** use the same unified NN table as duplexes. There is no
     initiation term, because the fold is unimolecular.
   - **Terminal mismatch:** the first and last loop bases face each other
     across the closing base pair. They are scored with the terminal-mismatch
     table, for loops longer than 3 bases.
   - **Loop penalty** is treated as purely entropic, using the hairpin-loop
     ΔG37 of SantaLucia & Hicks (2004):

     | Loop (nt) | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 12  | 14  | 16  | 18  | 20  | 25  | 30  |
     |-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
     | ΔG37 (kcal/mol) | 3.5 | 3.5 | 3.3 | 4.0 | 4.2 | 4.3 | 4.5 | 4.6 | 5.0 | 5.1 | 5.3 | 5.5 | 5.7 | 6.1 | 6.3 |

     Lengths between entries are interpolated linearly. Beyond 30 nt, the
     penalty grows as ΔG(30) + 2.44 × R × T × ln(n / 30).

3. A hairpin melts where ΔG = 0, independent of concentration:

   ```
   Tm(1M) = ΔH / ΔS
   ```

   It is then salt-corrected with the Owczarzy (2008) formula, using the
   stem as the helix. That formula was fitted on duplexes, so this step is
   an approximation.

4. The fold with the highest Tm is reported.

#### Grading

A structure is graded against the Tm at which the primer itself anneals
(the annealed-part Tm for a tailed primer):

| Grade | Structure Tm |
|-------|--------------|
| good (green) | ≤ annealing Tm − 15 °C, or no structure |
| ok (amber)   | between annealing Tm − 15 °C and − 5 °C |
| poor (red)   | > annealing Tm − 5 °C |

A structure that pairs the oligo's 3' end is graded one step worse, because
a polymerase can extend it into primer-dimer or self-primed product.

For probes, the card also checks the TaqMan rules:
- **5' base:** a G at the 5' end quenches the reporter dye.
- **Tm margin:** the probe's Tm minus the higher Tm of the nearest flanking
  primer pair (within 2 kb). ≥ 6 °C is good, 3–6 °C is ok, less is poor.

## Restriction Enzyme Database

The enzyme database is auto-generated from **REBASE** (Roberts et al.) using
`scripts/build-enzyme-db.ts`. The current build contains 546 enzymes with:

- Recognition sequences (IUPAC ambiguity codes)
- Cut positions on both strands
- Overhang type (blunt, 5' overhang, 3' overhang)
- Commercial supplier availability (NEB, Thermo, etc.)
- Isoschizomer grouping
- Methylation sensitivity (dam, dcm, CpG)
- Optimal temperature and heat inactivation data

The enzyme finder runs in a Web Worker. It expands IUPAC ambiguity codes into
all possible concrete sequences and scans both strands of the target sequence.
Results are grouped by isoschizomer family on the plasmid map to reduce visual
clutter.

## Primers

### Primers as oligos

A primer is stored as the oligo you would order: its full 5'→3' sequence,
tails included (`app/src/primers/oligo.ts`). Where it binds is never stored.
It is recomputed from the sequence (`binding.ts`): 10-mer seeds find candidate
diagonals on both strands in one pass over the template, and the best-scoring
run of paired bases along each diagonal is the annealed part. Whatever lies
outside that run is a tail, so overhangs (restriction sites, homology arms,
promoters) need no special handling. Mismatches inside the run are allowed;
a primer only counts as bound where its 3' end pairs, a probe anywhere.

Tailed primers have two Tms, both shown: the annealed part (first cycles)
and the whole oligo (once the tail is copied into the product). SnapGene
files keep the full sequence; GenBank writes one `primer_bind` feature per
binding site with the oligo in `/primer_sequence`.

Hovering a primer or probe on the sequence or map shows its Tm, GC, length,
hairpin and self-dimer Tm with a traffic-light grade (see "Hairpin and
self-dimer Tm" above), the restriction sites in its 5' tail and, for probes,
the TaqMan checks. Tap Shift while any hover card is open to pin it, so its
text can be selected; Esc or a click elsewhere unpins it. Right-clicking
opens a compact menu (summary line, then actions, with Copy, New Primer and
Origin in submenus). It works with the arrow keys and scrolls on short
screens.

### Design workbench

The Design view of the sidebar's Primers tab, with five tasks:

- **PCR / qPCR** - a pair (and optionally a TaqMan probe) around a target
- **Cloning** - binding parts that start exactly at the insert's ends, behind
  restriction-site tails (with padding, and a warning if the enzyme also cuts
  the insert) or homology arms read off a vector (Gibson / In-Fusion)
- **Mutagenesis** - substitutions, insertions and deletions, back-to-back
  (Q5 SDM style) or overlapping (QuikChange rule, Tm ≥ 78 °C); the mutant
  can be opened as a new sequence
- **Sequencing** - primers tiled so reads overlap across a region, each
  binding the template exactly once
- **Check a primer** - where an oligo binds in every open sequence

Any forward/reverse pick can be run as an in-silico PCR (`primers/pcr.ts`):
the product opens as a new sequence with both 5' tails built in and the
template's features carried over, ready for the cloning dialog.

### Primer library

Oligos you keep across sequences, listed in the explorer's **Oligos** group
(folders, tags, notes, stars and search as for any item). A library oligo
that binds the open sequence carries a badge; opening one shows where it
binds in every open sequence. When you open a sequence that library primers
bind, a notice offers them, and the Primers tab lists them with Add buttons.
Library oligos are copied onto a sequence, not linked, so editing one leaves
the other alone.

Oligos come in by paste or file (CSV/TSV with Name and Sequence columns,
"name sequence" lines, bare sequences or FASTA; unreadable lines are
listed) and go out as CSV, FASTA or a tab-separated order sheet (Name,
Sequence, Scale, Purification, as vendor bulk-entry forms take them). The
library is saved with the session and included in session export.

In the PCR task the target follows the selection; regions can be excluded. Each run returns the best pairs and the
whole candidate landscape (best candidate per 3' end), drawn as a track so
either side can be picked on its own. Picks are oligo sequences: they can be
trimmed or extended along the template, are drawn on the sequence and map as
dashed previews, and are re-scored as a pair live. Presets set the ranges;
buffer presets set the salt and oligo concentrations for the Tm model.

### Overview of the search

1. **Enumerate candidates** - slide windows of varying length upstream (forward)
   and downstream (reverse) of the target region, skipping excluded regions
2. **Score each candidate** - evaluate against thermodynamic and structural
   criteria, producing a weighted penalty with a per-term breakdown
3. **Pair candidates** - combine the best 200 of each side, filter by product
   size, and add pair-level penalties (Tm matching, cross-dimer)
4. **Rank and return** - sort pairs by total penalty; return the top pairs and
   the thinned candidate lists

A target longer than the maximum product is reported, not worked around by
changing the settings.

### Individual Primer Scoring

Each candidate primer is evaluated on multiple criteria. Hard constraints
reject the primer entirely; soft penalties contribute to a weighted score.

#### Hard Constraints (reject if violated)

| Criterion | Default range |
|-----------|---------------|
| Tm | 57-63 °C |
| GC content | 40-60% |
| Homopolymer run | ≤ 4 bases |

#### Soft Penalties (weighted score)

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Tm deviation | 1.0 per °C | Distance from optimal Tm (default 60°C) |
| Length deviation | 0.5 per base | Distance from optimal length (default 20 bp) |
| GC deviation | 0.1 per % | Distance from 50% GC |
| No GC clamp | +1.0 | No G or C in the last 2 bases at the 3' end |
| 3' stability (too stable) | +2.0 | ΔG₃₇ of last 5 bases < −9.0 kcal/mol |
| 3' stability (too weak) | +1.0 | ΔG₃₇ of last 5 bases > −5.0 kcal/mol |
| Self-complementarity ≥ 8 bp | +3.0 | Significant self-dimer potential |
| Self-complementarity ≥ 5 bp | +1.0 | Moderate self-dimer potential |
| 3' end self-dimer ≥ 4 bp | +4.0 | 3' end can pair with itself (blocks extension) |
| 3' end self-dimer ≥ 3 bp | +1.5 | Moderate 3' dimer risk |
| Hairpin stem ≥ 4 bp | +2.0 | Can fold into a hairpin |
| Hairpin stem ≥ 3 bp | +0.5 | Weak hairpin potential |
| Homopolymer run ≥ 3 | +0.5 per extra base | Soft penalty for long runs |

### Pair Scoring

```
pair_penalty = fwd_penalty + rev_penalty
             + |Tm_fwd − Tm_rev| × 1.0        (Tm matching)
             + |product_size − optimal| × 0.01  (product size)
             + cross_dimer_penalty               (3' cross-dimer)
```

### Thermodynamics

Tm uses the unified nearest-neighbour parameters with the Owczarzy (2008)
salt correction (monovalent and Mg²⁺, with Mg²⁺ bound by dNTPs), and is
validated against Biopython's `Tm_NN` reference values. A primer's Tm at a
binding site is taken against the template bases it faces: internal
mismatches use the Allawi & SantaLucia / Peyret tables and the first tail
base the terminal-mismatch table (tables from Biopython, BSD 3-Clause; see
`primers/thermo/tables.ts`). Dimer ΔG allows single internal mismatches;
loops and bulges are not modelled. An off-target scan reports weaker sites
where a primer's last 8 bases pair perfectly.

The cross-dimer check considers the 3' end of both primers. (Before the
workbench it checked the second primer's 5' end by mistake, so a dimer on the
reverse primer's 3' end went unpenalised.)

### User-Configurable Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Tm range | 57-63 °C | Min/max acceptable Tm |
| Optimal Tm | 60 °C | Target Tm for penalty calculation |
| Primer length | 18-25 bp | Min/max primer length |
| Product size | 150-1000 bp | Min/max amplicon size |
| GC content | 40-60% | Min/max GC of each primer |
| Na⁺ concentration | 50 mM | Monovalent cation concentration for Tm calculation |
| Mg²⁺ / dNTPs | 1.5 / 0.8 mM | Divalent correction, free Mg²⁺ = Mg²⁺ − dNTPs |
| Primer concentration | 250 nM | Oligo concentration for Tm calculation |

Presets: Standard PCR, GC-rich template, Long amplicon (1-5 kb) and qPCR with
probe (70-150 bp, probe Tm 68-72 °C).

## Codon Optimization

Rewrites a coding region for expression in another host: pick the codons the
host translates well, keep the restriction sites your cloning strategy needs
free, and stay inside what a synthesis vendor will accept.

The protein is the invariant. Whatever the settings, the optimizer re-translates
its own output and throws if it does not match the input protein, rather than
returning a sequence that codes for something else.

### Targets

| Target | What it optimizes |
|--------|-------------------|
| Selection | The selected bases, read in frame from the first one |
| Coding features | Every CDS-like feature, individually checkable |
| Whole sequence | Frame 1 from position 0 |

A feature on the minus strand is read and written back in its own orientation,
`/codon_start` is honoured, and an origin-spanning feature on a circular
sequence is followed round the join. Each region is reduced to a coding-strand
string plus a map from every base back to its genomic index, so those three
cases share one code path rather than three.

Two CDSs that share bases cannot both be optimized: rewriting one changes the
other's reading frame. The first wins and the overlap is reported.

### Genetic codes

19 NCBI translation tables (1-6, 9-14, 16, 21-26), stored as diffs against the
standard code. This decides which codons are synonymous, so a mitochondrial
gene is not truncated at a TGA that codes for tryptophan in its own code.
`utils/codon.ts` re-exports table 1, so the app has one copy of the standard
code rather than two that can drift.

### Codon usage tables

| Source | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Built-in | E. coli K-12, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris, H. sapiens, CHO, Sf9, A. thaliana |
| Imported | EMBOSS cusp (.cusp) and GCG CodonFrequency (.cod). Persisted in IndexedDB. |

The built-in tables are written from published genome-wide averages and are
flagged `approximate` in the data and in the UI: the rankings and rare-codon
calls are right, the low-order digits may differ from a particular reference.
Import a table when the exact figures matter.

Both formats are whitespace-aligned tables with a header naming their columns,
and they order those columns differently:

```
cusp    #Codon AA Fraction Frequency Number
GCG      AmAcid Codon Number /1000 Fraction ..
```

So the header is read and the columns taken by name, preferring Fraction, then
the per-thousand frequency, then the raw count. Within a family all three are
proportional, so the choice is about robustness rather than correctness: some
GCG tables ship with the count column zeroed. Anything else with one codon and
one number per line is still accepted as a plain list, which covers a Kazusa
block or a quick paste.

A family with no usage stays at zero rather than being spread evenly, so
`unusableResidues` can report an amino acid the table cannot encode instead of
the optimizer silently inventing a preference.

### What gets changed

- **Every codon**, choosing either the most frequent synonym or one sampled
  from the host distribution. Sampling is seeded, so a run reproduces exactly,
  and it avoids the long identical runs that "most frequent" produces.
- **Rare codons only**, above a configurable within-family threshold.

### Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Forbidden motifs | Enzyme groups, individual enzymes, custom IUPAC motifs, and presets for Type IIS sites, internal Shine-Dalgarno, polyA signals, cryptic splice sites and E. coli promoter boxes. Checked on both strands. |
| Homopolymers | Separate limits for A/T and G/C runs |
| GC content | Global bounds plus a sliding local window |
| Repeats | Direct repeats over N bp |
| Hairpins | Inverted repeats with a stem over N bp within a loop distance |
| CpG | Avoided when asked, for mammalian constructs |
| Locked codons | Start, stop, the first N codons, and anything under a protected non-coding feature |

Constraints are checked across the region boundary into the untouched flanks,
so a site that would straddle the edge is still avoided.

### Algorithm

Greedy left to right with bounded backtracking. Each codon takes the best
synonym that leaves the window it can affect free of violations; when nothing
fits, the walk steps back and tries the previous codon's next choice. Past the
step budget it keeps the best remaining option and reports the violation rather
than failing the whole run.

A full dynamic program is not an option here: the state would have to be the
last K bases, where K is the longest constraint window, so the table is 4^K
wide.

Direct repeats are the one constraint that is not local, since the other copy
can be anywhere. They are tracked in an index built as the walk proceeds and
rolled back on backtracking, which keeps the run linear where re-scanning per
codon would make it quadratic.

Optimization runs on the main thread. A few thousand codons take milliseconds,
and the dialog previews on a 200 ms debounce; past 60 kb of target it waits for
an explicit run instead.

### Metrics

CAI, GC, GC3, rare codon count and the longest A/T and G/C runs, before and
after. CAI is the geometric mean of relative adaptiveness over the region,
skipping single-codon families (Met, Trp), which carry no information about
adaptation and would only drag every score toward 1.

### Applying

Applying is an equal-length substitution through `substituteBasesInPlace`: one
undo entry, and no annotation moves, because no coordinate changes. This is why
it does not reuse `replaceBases`, which deletes then inserts, and would drop
the very CDS being optimized (an annotation fully inside a deleted range is
removed). The result can also be opened as a new sequence, leaving the original
untouched.

## PDF Export

File > Export PDF (Ctrl+P) writes the sequence as the text view draws it:
base colours, complement, feature bars, primers, ORFs, cut sites and
translations, laid out on A4 pages. The bases to export are the whole
sequence, the rows in view, the selection or a typed range (through the
origin on a circular sequence). Optional extras: a plasmid map page for
circular sequences, a feature table and a restriction site table (both
limited to the exported range), and a header with the title, length and
page numbers.

### One painter, two outputs

The row drawing lives in one function (`components/sequence-paint.ts`) that
the screen and the export both call. For the PDF it draws into `PdfCanvas`
(`pdf/canvas.ts`), an object with the subset of the Canvas 2D API the
painters use (paths, arcs, rectangles, text, dashes, alpha, save/restore,
transforms) that writes PDF operators instead of pixels. The plasmid map's
renderer draws into the same object. The export therefore cannot drift from
the view: a change to how features or translations are drawn reaches both.

Rejected alternatives:
- **Printing through the browser** (as the alignment figure does) gives no
  control over page breaks, so a line and its features can split across
  pages, and the user has to go through the print dialog every time.
- **Rasterising each page** would be exact but not searchable, large, and
  blurry when zoomed.
- **A PDF library** would add weight to a single-file app for what is a
  small amount of format: the writer (`pdf/document.ts`) is a page tree,
  Flate-compressed content streams (fflate, already used for Geneious
  files) and an xref table.

### Layout

Rows are laid out in the view's own pixel units and scaled to the page
width, so letters, labels and bars keep their on-screen proportions. At
letters zoom the line length is the screen's by default, or a fixed 50 to
150 bases; the row is as wide as that many cells at the current zoom's cell
width, and the dialog reports the resulting letter size in points (under
5 pt it suggests fewer bases or landscape). Below letters zoom the overview
prints as on screen, scaled so its labels land near 7 pt. A line is never
split across pages. The map page and the tables follow the same rule: a
table's heading, header and first row stay together, and the header row
repeats on each new page.

Feature lanes are not capped at the screen's four: paper cannot be hovered
to reveal "+N more", so print shows every lane up to 16.

### Fonts and text

The PDF uses three of the standard 14 fonts (Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold,
Courier), which every reader provides, so nothing is embedded. Their glyph
widths are fixed by the Adobe font metrics, which lets the export measure
labels exactly without a canvas; the painter is handed these metrics, so
label fitting and enzyme label tiers are computed for the glyphs that will
print. Monospaced text prints in Courier, the rest in Helvetica.

The sequence letters of a line are written as one text run with character
spacing set to the cell width, and tagged with `/ActualText` so copy and
search read "ACGT" rather than "A C G T" (readers that honour it, such as
Acrobat and Chrome's viewer; pdf.js extracts the spaced form).

### Colours

The export always uses the light theme's colours on white, read from the
theme tokens through a hidden probe element rather than copied. Dark themes
are made for a dark canvas (pale text, bright bases) and would print as
faint marks on white. Selection and search highlights are off by default.

### Limits

- The standard fonts use WinAnsiEncoding (Latin-1 plus typographic marks).
  Greek letters in names are spelled out ("beta-lactamase"); other
  characters outside the set print as "?".
- Exports over 1,500 pages are refused; choose a smaller range or zoom out.
- Writing runs on the main thread in batches, so a long export keeps the
  dialog responsive and can be stopped.
